<h2>Band History</h2>

<p>
The Band was formed in October 2013 by Viator Noctis, Ryu, Koshmar and N&aacute;r in Aachen, Germany. Four individuals with different
opinions and backgrounds found together with the idea that unified them all: To create music that not only touches the inner
daemons, but also tries to embrace all the furor that surrounds us in our life. The result is a mix of harsh and raw Black Metal
with melodical outbreaks that defines the tune of Ius Talionis. <br>
The first rehearsals started and the first song began to shape it‘s form. In the beginning of 2014, Eremos found his way into
the band, completing the line up. The creative process proceeded and four different songs began to manifest themselves. On 22nd
March the first song "Im Angesicht des Todes" (translation: In the face of death) was published and was well received. Until
summer the songs were finished, and the recording of the first demo "Eleutheromania" began in their own rehearsal room.<br>
The title means an obsession or desire for freedom, a path to self-illumination through breaking the shackles of our society and
also our mind through different means, like Lucifer, the fallen Morning Star or Prometheus did before. The demo was released on
6th September 2014 on the first gig of the Band in Aachen, Germany.</p>
<p>After a number of concerts the band withdrew from the public to work on new songs. It was in this time when Nár and the band decided to part ways. Ryu took over the position as bass player and Demiurg joined the band as new drummer. Again in a full cast, the band works on their new Album "Saligia". In this time Ryu left the band on good terms, Moros replaced him.</p>
